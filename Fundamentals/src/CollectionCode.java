What is Collections ?
it is simply an objects represent group of objects knows as elements group of string ,integer, booleans


then what is collection framework ?
it provides set of interface and classes that help in managing group of objects



before java version 1.2 it uses
vectorstack, stack, hashtable and arrays but it has drawbacks

1. incossitency
2. don't have common interface
3. lack og inter operability 

collection framework in JAVA 2

feature 
unified architecture
inter-operability
Reusability
efficiency


key interfaces

Collection : The root interface for all the other collection types 
List : An Ordered Collection Types that can contain duplicate elements (eg ArrayList, LinkedList)
Set : A collection that cannot contain duplicate elements and also unorderd format (eg. Hashset, TreeSet)
Queue : A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing in sequential order (eg. Priority Queue, )
Deque : A double Ended queue that allows insertion and removal from both ends ()
Map: A interface which represent the collection of key value pairs.(Hashmap , Treemap)



iterables 


List : ArrayList, LinkedList , Vector , stack ,

set : Hashset, LinkedHashset, Treeset , enumset, sortedset , 

queue : linkedlist, priority queue

Deque : arraydequeue, linkedlist,
